# TIKTOK SEARCH

Search tiktok for a query, and then all loaded videos are downloaded and merged into one video file.

Useful for:
> 1. doing tiktok searches (But it is very slow right now and no ideal due to captcha)
> 2. Making Tiktok Compilation Videos

Used external Libraries:
> - Selenium for loading the tiktok results
> - requests for downloading the tiktok videos
> - Moviepy for merging all the videos

TO DO:
> - [ ] Explore reliable ways to avoid the captcha
> - [ ] Moviepy is pretty slow in merging: Could there be a faster way?
> - [ ] When both of them are done, connect to a telegram bot
> - [ ] when connected to a telegram bot: Compress file to meet [bot api limit](https://core.telegram.org/bots/faq#how-do-i-upload-a-large-file) or find another way to share the file
